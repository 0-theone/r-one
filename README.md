# r-one
In the beginning, there was R and R had a decent amount of functionatlity, any aspiring data handler could download or install it and carry out her analysis, and ploting and graphing... And everybody was happy. But then the people with the big brains came. They started doing their more advanced or more specific analyses. Our code, they thought, could be useful for others. Let's put it in a package and make it available for everyone to use. And so they did! And so the comprehensive archive network or CRANN began to grow with each new package created and stored. (CRAN) - That's the idea behind R packages. They enable you to increase the functionality of R, and since R an open source software and every well wishing big Brainer can contribute their own package, the CRAN is a cornucopia of resources. Use it and you can do a lot, a lot of data analysis even without being a superstar programmer.
